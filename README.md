# Audio Transcription and Analysis with Deepgram and OpenAI

This project is a Python application that leverages the Deepgram and OpenAI APIs to transcribe audio and perform various language tasks on the transcriptions. The results are then stored using Anvil's app_tables. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following Python libraries installed:

- os
- deepgram
- openai
- anvil.tables
- python-dotenv

You will also need API keys for Deepgram and OpenAI.

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine.

## Anvil Best Practices

Anvil is a robust platform for creating web-based user interfaces (UI) using Python. Here are some best practices for using Anvil as a UI:

1. **Understand the Basics:** Get to know the Anvil editor, the toolbox, and the properties panel. The editor is where you design your forms, the toolbox contains the components you can use, and the properties panel lets you configure the selected component.

2. **Use Drag-and-Drop Design:** Anvil provides a drag-and-drop interface for designing your UI. You can select components from the toolbox and place them on your form.

3. **Leverage Built-in Components:** Anvil provides a variety of built-in components such as buttons, text boxes, labels, and more. Use these components to quickly build your UI.

4. **Customize with Python:** You can customize the behavior of your UI components using Python. Each form is a Python class, and you can write Python code to handle events like button clicks.

5. **Use Data Bindings:** Anvil supports data bindings, which allow you to link the properties of UI components to Python code. This can be used to dynamically update your UI based on user input or other events.

6. **Utilize Anvil Services:** Anvil provides several built-in services like databases, user authentication, and email. These services can be easily integrated into your UI.

7. **Test Your UI:** Anvil provides a built-in environment for testing your UI. You can run your app within the Anvil editor and see how it behaves.

8. **Deploy Your App:** Once you're satisfied with your UI, you can deploy your app with a single click. Anvil hosts your app and provides a URL that you can share.

> Remember, the Anvil documentation is a great resource if you need more detailed information or tutorials.


## 5 Optimized Paths
1. **Create a User Interface in Anvil:** You can use Anvil's drag-and-drop designer to create a user interface for your application. This could include elements like buttons to start and stop the transcription process, text boxes to display the transcriptions and results of the language tasks, and options to control the transcription parameters.

2. **Call Python Functions from Anvil:** Anvil allows you to call Python functions from your user interface. You can use this feature to call the process_audio function in main.py when a button is clicked in the Anvil app. You can pass the audio source and other parameters from the Anvil app to the function.

3. **Display Results in Anvil:** After the process_audio function is called, you can display the results in the Anvil app. You can use Anvil's data bindings to link the results to the properties of UI components, such as the text of a label or the value of a text box.

4. **Use Anvil's Server Modules:** You can move some or all of the code in main.py to an Anvil Server Module. This would allow the code to run on the server side, which could be beneficial for tasks like audio transcription and language tasks that require significant processing power.

5. **Deploy the Anvil App:** Once you've built your Anvil app and integrated it with the main.py script, you can deploy the app with a single click. Anvil hosts your app and provides a URL that you can share. This would allow others to use your transcription and language task application from any device with a web browser.

## Additional Points
Here are some additional points that might be helpful:

1. **Anvil Uplink:** Anvil Uplink allows you to connect your local Python scripts to your Anvil app. This can be useful if you want to keep your main.py script on your local machine and call its functions from your Anvil app.

2. **Anvil Server Functions:** Anvil allows you to define server functions that can be called from the client side. This can be useful for tasks that require significant processing power or access to secure resources.

3. **Anvil Media Objects:** If your audio source is a file uploaded through the Anvil app, you can use Anvil's Media object to handle the file. The Media object can be passed to your transcribe_audio function and used as the audio source.

4. **Error Handling:** Your main.py script includes error handling for the transcription and language tasks, but you might also want to add error handling in your Anvil app. For example, you could display an error message in the app if the process_audio function returns None.

5. **Anvil App Secrets:** If you're storing API keys or other sensitive information in your Anvil app, you can use Anvil's App Secrets service to securely store this information.

6. **Anvil Pricing:** Depending on your needs, you might need to consider Anvil's pricing. Some features, such as using your own domain name for your app and removing the Anvil branding, are only available on paid plans.

7. **Anvil Deployment:** Anvil provides several options for deploying your app, including hosting on Anvil's servers, hosting on your own servers, and on-site deployment.
